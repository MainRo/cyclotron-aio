This project is not mainained anymore. It has been split between `cyclotron
<https://github.com/mainro/cyclotron-py/>`_. and `cyclotron-aiohttp
<https://github.com/mainro/cyclotron-aiohttp/>`_.

The asyncio runner is now part of the cyclotron package. The aiohttp client and
server drivers are now in the cyclotron-aiohttp package.
